    "## Cloud Providers Vs Databases\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "   During earlier days companies use files, papers, racks, boxes to save and write their datas. When the papers becomes digitilized the database concepts was grownup silently. There will be a small computer with some mb of ram and hard disk, that stores the limited amount of data. Again after some years later like 20's companies ows a server room and keep their data safe and stores enormous amount of data and maintained them. But now the data generating speed become high, size becomes large, usege becomes heavy, maintanince become too tough.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   So there is a technique called \"Cloud Computing\" which was released at 1960's in US by CIS who was the online service provider at that time. They allow their users to store some limited amount of files by offering them a storage. Now there are three gaints who providing the cloud computing service popularly, which are AWS(amazon web service), GCP(google cloud platform, AZURE(microsoft azure), they gives the full computing power through online for any system on demand. We can store, deploy, fetch, build any kind of data/application here with some cost as per their allocation. Within these we have many sub-divisions which helps in providing their services, those are Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Database as as Service(DBaas).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Here we look into DBaas. MongoDb contains DBaas called \"MongoDb Atlas\", which was deployed fully managed MongoDb in AWS,GCP,AZURE and provides scalability, fexilibility, maintanince, avaliabality, security, privacy. Let us try to connect the mongodb compass and local system with cloud then store the data in it through python.    "
